There once was a dog named Oscar. Oscar ate some chocolate and felt sick.

Poor Oscar had a miserable day and did not want to play outside. Eventually, Oscar started to feel better and wanted to go on a walk. While walking with his owner, Oscar spotted a squirrel.

Oscar was fascinated as he had never seen a squirrel before. So, followed the squirrel around for a long time. Eventually, the squirrel led both Oscar and his owner to a cave where there were hundreds of squirrels waiting for him as if he were their leader.

Oscar became their king, and the squirrels became his best friends and loyal subjects! After a miserable day of feeling sad and sick, Oscar now was a king! He lived the rest of his life happily.
