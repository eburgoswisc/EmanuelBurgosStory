There once was a dog named Oscar. Oscar ate some chocolate and felt sick.

Poor Oscar had a miserable day and did not want to play outside. Eventually, Oscar started to feel better and wanted to go on a walk. While walking with his owner, Oscar spotted a squirrel.

Oscar was fascinated as he had never seen a squirrel before. So, followed the squirrel around for a long time. Eventually, the squirrel led both Oscar and his owner to a cave where there were hundreds of squirrels waiting for him as if he were their leader.
